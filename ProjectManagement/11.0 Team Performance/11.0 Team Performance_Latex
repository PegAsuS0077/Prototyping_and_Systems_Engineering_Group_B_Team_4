\section{Team Performance}

We worked extremely hard and also invested significant time in testing and re-testing to ensure that our modest design meets the core aim of the project, which is:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The ability of our designed robot to perform the following tasks successfully:}
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item To follow a dark lane and travel through an oval path.
    \item To sense and detect an obstacle and follow our desired instructions programmed in Arduino IDE~\cite{arduino}.
    \item To avoid obstacles it sensed, return back to the lane, and continue its travel via the assigned tracks.
\end{enumerate}

In the Group A and Group B teams' racing and obstacle avoidance contest, we won the competition with a record travel time of less than \textbf{29 seconds} across the oval track.

\subsection*{Future Trajectory}

We aim to investigate further into robotics by applying the skills acquired in this course and project to design a car with similar capabilities. This new system will integrate additional features such as artificial intelligence and real-life camera sensing devices.

We highly recommend this course to any Electrical and Electronic Engineering student, or indeed to any innovative-minded individual. There should be no limits if we push hard with unwavering effort.
