\subsection*{Project Objectives}

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an autonomous robotic vehicle capable of navigating dynamic environments using a sensor-driven control system. The following key goals guide the design and implementation phases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Autonomous Lane Following:} Develop a reliable lane-following mechanism using Infrared (IR) sensors. The system should be capable of detecting and tracking predefined lanes with precision, including handling curves and intersections effectively.
    
    \item \textbf{Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:} Integrate ultrasonic sensors to facilitate real-time obstacle detection. The robotic vehicle should be able to measure distance to nearby objects and initiate avoidance maneuvers autonomously to prevent collisions.

    \item \textbf{Color-Based Decision Making:} Implement a color recognition system to classify and respond to different types of obstacles. For example, red objects may signal a full stop, while green may indicate a clear path or require an alternate route. This enables dynamic and context-aware navigation.

    \item \textbf{Modular and Power-Efficient Design:} Design the hardware to be modular, allowing easy replacement and testing of individual components. Power efficiency will be emphasized to prolong operational time, utilizing optimized power management strategies across all modules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Scope of the Project}

This project encompasses both hardware and embedded software development, with a strong emphasis on reliability, sensor fusion, and system integration. Key aspects of the scope include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hardware Integration and Mechanical Design:} Selection, configuration, and interfacing of sensors (IR and ultrasonic), motor drivers, microcontrollers, and power supply units. Custom mechanical components—such as sensor holders, battery enclosures, and structural frames—were designed using SolidWorks. This CAD-based approach allowed for accurate measurements, modularity, and efficient assembly of all physical parts.

    \item \textbf{Software Development:} Development of embedded firmware to process sensor data, control actuators, and execute decision-making algorithms. Emphasis will be placed on efficient code structure, interrupt-driven design, and real-time responsiveness.

    \item \textbf{System Testing and Validation:} Rigorous testing will be conducted to evaluate the system's performance under different environmental conditions. This includes assessing the accuracy of lane-following, obstacle detection range, decision logic correctness, and overall system robustness.

    \item \textbf{Scalability and Extensibility:} While the initial prototype will demonstrate core functionalities, the system will be designed with future enhancements in mind, including potential wireless communication, machine learning integration, or advanced navigation algorithms.
\end{itemize}

In summary, this project aims to deliver a functional, intelligent robotic vehicle by effectively integrating sensing, decision-making, mechanical design, and control into a unified, modular, and energy-efficient system.
