\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the design and implementation of an autonomous robotic vehicle capable of line following and obstacle avoidance using infrared (IR) and ultrasonic sensors. The robot is enhanced with a color detection system to enable dynamic decision-making based on object classification. It is built using low-cost, modular components and is powered by an Arduino Uno R4 microcontroller programmed in embedded C++. IR sensors allow the robot to track predefined paths, while the ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles within a 25 cm range. A color sensor evaluates the surface color of detected objects, guiding the robot to reroute, pause, or realign accordingly. To ensure robust integration and mechanical stability, custom holders for various components were designed and fabricated using SolidWorks and 3D printing, allowing precise and secure attachment to the chassis. The final prototype demonstrates reliable autonomous navigation, sensor fusion, and expandability, making it well-suited for educational, research, and automation applications.
