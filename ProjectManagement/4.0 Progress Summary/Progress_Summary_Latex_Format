\section{Progress Summary}

The project successfully reached completion after progressing through several structured development stages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanical Design:}  
    The project began with systems engineering training and receipt of the project requirement from the professor. Thereafter,the mechanical parts were received in the lab. Custom holders for sensors and the battery were designed by us using SolidWorks and fabricated using 3D-printer. This additional parts provided a stable and modular foundation for effective assembly and efficient performance of our vehicle.

    \item \textbf{Component Integration:}  
    Once the frame and holders were ready, each electronic component was tested individually. The IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, TCS3200 color sensor, motor driver (SBC Motor Driver 2), and 12V LiPo battery were all verified for functionality before being integrated into the autonomous vehicle system.

    \item \textbf{Core Functionality Development:}  
    With hardware in place, development moved to software. The robot was programmed to follow a predefined lane using IR sensors, followed by ultrasonic-based obstacle detection within a 25 cm range. The TCS3200 color sensor was calibrated to distinguish between obstacle types (Color A and Color B), enabling the robot to take appropriate actions based on object color.

    \item \textbf{Advanced Behavior Implementation:}  
    The robot was enhanced with advanced obstacle avoidance maneuvers. It can now bypass obstacles autonomously and return to the original lane without external assistance. PID control logic was used to ensure smooth lane following and stable turning behavior.

    \item \textbf{Testing, Challenges, and Finalization:}  
    The system was tested extensively under different lighting and surface conditions. The main challenges included color sensor calibration in varied lighting and PID tuning for smooth motion. These were overcome through iterative testing and adjustments. All planned objectives were achieved.

    \item \textbf{Final Status:}  
    The robotic vehicle demonstrates all core capabilities â€” lane following, real-time obstacle avoidance, color-based decision making, and autonomous path correction. The final system is stable, efficient, and ready for deployment.
